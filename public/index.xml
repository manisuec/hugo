      <guid>https://techinsights.manisuec.com/post/2021-08-11-understand-event-loop-in-nodejs/</guid>
      <description>Event Loop is what allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations — despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded — by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.
