## **What is destructuring assignment?**

> The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.

*-* [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)

In essence, it is a convenient way to extract value/values from data stored in (possibly nested) objects and arrays. This feature was introduced in the 6th Edition of the ECMAScript standard, ES6 for short. It makes code concise, more readable and helps to avoid repeated destructing expressions.

## Use Cases

1. [**To get values in variable from objects, array**](#usecase_1)
- [To combine an array at any place with another array](#usecase_2)
- [To combine an array at any place with another array](#usecase_3)
- [To combine an array at any place with another array](#usecase_4)
- [To combine an array at any place with another array](#usecase_5)
- [To combine an array at any place with another array](#usecase_6)
- [To combine an array at any place with another array](#usecase_7)
- [To combine an array at any place with another array](#usecase_8)
- [To combine an array at any place with another array](#usecase_9)
- [To combine an array at any place with another array](#usecase_10)
- [To combine an array at any place with another array](#usecase_11)
- [To combine an array at any place with another array](#usecase_12)
- [To combine an array at any place with another array](#usecase_7)


### <a name="usecase_1"></a> To get values in variable from objects, array




## Conclusion

In this example, we can see that by using Nodejs streams, we can manipulate large sets of data very efficiently both in terms of memory and time. I reiterate, streams are a highly underrated but very powerful concept in Node.js. Hopefully, this article will help in understanding of streams, how to work with them and where to use this module.
