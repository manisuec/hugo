After years of web development, do you still find yourself mixing up `for...in` and `for...of` loops in JavaScript? If you're tired of Googling every time you need to loop through a collection, I've got a handy memory trick to help you effortlessly remember when to use each loop statement.

> a)  "index in, object of"
> 
> b) 'i'n -> not 'i'terables, o'f -> not 'o'bjects

[for...in](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in) loops over enumerable property names of an object.

[for...of](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) (new in ES6) does use an object-specific iterator and loops over the values generated by that.


### Code Snippet:

```javascript
const colorsArr = ['Red', 'Blue', 'Green', 'White'];

for (const color in colorsArr) {
	console.log(color);
}

// Output
0
1
2
3
```

Almost everytime I expect that value of colors will be printed instead of index values. To get the values we have to modify the loop as below 

```javascript
const colorsArr = ['Red', 'Blue', 'Green', 'White'];

for (const color in colorsArr) {   // it makes more sense
	console.log(colorsArr[color]);  // to rename color to index
}

// Output
Red
Blue
Green
White
```

Using `for...of` loop

```javascript
const colorsArr = ['Red', 'Blue', 'Green', 'White'];

for (const color of colorsArr) {
	console.log(color);
}

// Output
Red
Blue
Green
White
```

### Difference

| | `for...in` | `for...of` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Applies to  | Enumerable Properties | Iterable Collections |
| Use with Objects?    | Yes | No |
| Use with Arrays?	   | Yes, but not advised | Yes |
| Use with Strings?    | Yes, but not advised | Yes |

I will not go much into the differences; you can read the blog [JavaScript for…of vs for…in Loops (A Complete Guide)](https://www.codingem.com/javascript-for-of-vs-for-in-loops/)

However, I prefer to use `for...of` almost everywhere. Infact for looping over properties of an object too; I prefer `for...of` loop like below:

```
const person = {
  name: 'Manish Prasad',
  age: 37,
  job: 'developer'
};

for (const key of Object.keys(person)) {
  console.log(key + ': ' + person[key]);
}

// Output

name: Manish Prasad
age: 37
job: developer
```

### Conclusion:

In this post, I have not dived much deep into the differences. I prefer to use `for...of` loop almost everytime. Another big advantage of preferring `for...of` loop is [early exiting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of#early_exiting).
